Baltimore Area Survey Data
==========================

This repository contains data for the Baltimore Area Surveys.

The surveys are conducted annually by the [21st Century Cities Initiative (21CC)](https://21cc.jhu.edu/) at Johns Hopkins University. The data are collected from independent samples of adult residents in Baltimore City and Baltimore County every year. The data are organized by year, with documentation for each wave of data contained within the directory for that year. 

More information about the Baltimore Area Survey can be found on the [21CC website](https://21cc.jhu.edu/bas). Questions about the data can be directed to 21cc@jhu.edu.

Surveys are organized by year in the `data` directory. The data are saved in both a comma-delimited version (`.csv`) and as an R data file (`.Rdata`). R is an [open-source statistical software program](https://www.r-project.org/) that can be used for data visualization and analysis. 

Documentation for surveys can be found at https://jhucities.github.io/baltimore-area-survey-data/.
